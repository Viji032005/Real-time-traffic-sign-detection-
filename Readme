ABSTRACT
     Real-time traffic sign detection involves using computer vision and machine learning to automatically identify and recognize traffic signs in real-time video streams, often from vehiclemounted cameras. This technology plays a crucial role in advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving, enhancing road safety and driver awareness.  
 1. Setup Environment:Ensure you have Python 3.5 or higher and install the necessary libraries: pip installs opencvpython 
 2. Data Collection:Gather a dataset of traffic sign images for training. You can use existing datasets like the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) or create your own by capturing images from videos.
 3. Detection Phase: Utilize image processing techniques to detect traffic signs: Increase contrast and dynamic range of video frames. Use HSV color space to filter out unnecessary colors. Apply Laplacian of Gaussian for edge detection. Create contours and identify ellipse-like or circle-like shapes.
 4. Classification Phase: Train an SVM model to classify detected signs: Crop images based on detected contours. Use a pre-trained SVM model for classification.
 5. Real-Time Implementation: Integrate the detection and classification into a real-time system: Capture video from a webcam or recorded file. Process each frame to detect and classify traffic signs in real time.
 6. Performance Optimization:Consider using advanced models like YOLO or SSD for improved accuracy and speed, as they can handle dynamic conditions better than traditional methods.
